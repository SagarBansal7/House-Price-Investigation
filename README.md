On an individual level, the real estate markets form as one of the most reliable ways for investors to grow their personal wealth. They qualify as a safe and potential investment option to secure income stability. On a much more global scale, property prices are becoming increasingly important and beneficial, the ability to identify price trends in properties serve as markers for indicating the overall market condition and the economic health of a country. This makes it a somewhat interesting investment category for analysis as there exists no standard source of real estate valuation. 

Our analysis emphasizes on investigating the different factors that are correlated with the price of a house in ten cities in the state of Washington. The cities that we studied were Seattle, Renton, Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland, Issaquah, Kent, Auburn, Sammamish and Federal Way. We built a multiple linear regression model with variables such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage of living area, square footage of lot, number of floors, city, and age of the house out of 18 different variables in the beginning. After our analysis, we found that only square footage of lot does not add much to the average natural log of house price values when other features of the house remain same. The detailed explanation is provided in the report.
